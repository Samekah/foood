        <p> Laverbread ( / ˈ l ɑː v ər b r ɛ d / ; Welsh : bara lafwr or bara lawr ; Irish : sleabhac ) is a food product, made from the edible seaweed (littoral alga) consumed mainly in Wales as part of local traditional cuisine. The seaweed is commonly found around the west coast of Great Britain , and the coasts of Ireland where it is known as sleabhac . [1] It is smooth in texture and forms delicate, sheetlike thalli , often clinging to rocks. The principal variety is Porphyra umbilicalis . Porphyra (laver seaweed) is classified as red algae ; it tends to be a brownish colour, but boils down to a dark green pulp when prepared. Laver seaweed has a high content of dietary minerals , particularly iodine and iron . The high iodine content gives the seaweed a distinctive flavour in common with olives and oysters . </p>
